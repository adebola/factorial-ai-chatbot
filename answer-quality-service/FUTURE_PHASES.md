## Phase 6: Advanced ML & Predictive Analytics

**Status**: Shelved
**Reason**: Current VADER sentiment analysis is sufficient for initial needs. ML models add complexity and infrastructure requirements.

### Proposed Features

#### 1. Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis
Replace rule-based VADER with transformer-based models for more accurate sentiment detection:

- **Models**: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT
- **Benefits**: Better context understanding, multilingual support, higher accuracy
- **Infrastructure**: GPU support, model serving infrastructure
- **Latency**: 50-200ms vs <1ms for VADER

#### 2. Quality Prediction Models
Train models to predict answer quality before responses are sent:

- **Features**: Historical quality metrics, user patterns, question types
- **Use Case**: Pre-emptive quality warnings, response optimization
- **Training Data**: Accumulated feedback and quality metrics
- **Model Types**: Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), neural networks

#### 3. Anomaly Detection
Use unsupervised learning to detect unusual quality patterns:

- **Techniques**: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-class SVM
- **Detection**: Sudden quality drops, unusual feedback patterns
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerts before users notice issues
- **Benefits**: Early problem detection, reduced manual monitoring

#### 4. Answer Relevance Scoring
ML-based scoring to replace simple confidence metrics:

- **Features**: Semantic similarity, context matching, user satisfaction
- **Models**: Sentence transformers, cross-encoders
- **Integration**: Replace or augment existing retrieval scores
- **Benefits**: More accurate quality assessment

#### 5. Predictive Alerting
Alert before quality issues occur based on trend analysis:

- **Techniques**: Time series forecasting (LSTM, Prophet)
- **Predictions**: Quality degradation, spike in negative feedback
- **Lead Time**: Alert 1-24 hours before predicted issues
- **Use Case**: Proactive remediation

### Implementation Considerations

**Pros**:
- Higher accuracy for sentiment and quality detection
- Predictive capabilities for proactive management
- Continuous improvement through model retraining
- Better handling of edge cases and context

**Cons**:
- Significant infrastructure requirements (GPU, model servers)
- Increased latency (50-200ms vs <1ms)
- Model training and maintenance overhead
- Dependency on ML expertise
- Data requirements for training
- Cost of ML infrastructure

**Decision**: VADER provides adequate sentiment analysis for current needs with <1ms latency and zero infrastructure overhead. Revisit when accuracy requirements justify the complexity.

## Phase 7: Frontend Dashboard & Visualization

**Status**: Implementation Planned (Angular UI)
**Location**: Will be implemented in the Angular ChatCraft UI project, not as a backend feature

### Scope

All dashboard and visualization features will be built in the Angular frontend:

- Quality metrics charts and trends
- Knowledge gap explorer
- Alert rule management interface
- Scheduler monitoring
- Feedback statistics visualization

**Rationale**: Dashboards are presentation-layer concerns and belong in the frontend application. The backend provides APIs; the frontend consumes them.
