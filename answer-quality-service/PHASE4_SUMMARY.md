# Phase 4 Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Knowledge Gap Detection Service (`app/services/gap_detector.py`)

**Purpose**: Automatically identify recurring questions that receive low-quality answers.

**Key Features**:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts questions to numerical vectors for comparison
- **Cosine Similarity Clustering**: Groups similar questions together (>70% similarity threshold)
- **Smart Filtering**: Only flags questions with:
  - Low confidence scores (<0.5)
  - Negative user feedback
  - Poor retrieval scores
- **Minimum Occurrence**: Only creates gaps for patterns that appear 2+ times
- **Gap Management**: Acknowledge and resolve gaps with notes

**How It Works**:
```
1. Fetch low-quality messages from last N days
2. Extract question text from each message
3. Create TF-IDF vectors for all questions
4. Calculate similarity matrix using cosine similarity
5. Cluster similar questions (threshold: 0.7)
6. Create knowledge gap records for recurring patterns
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard API (`app/api/admin.py`)

**7 Admin Endpoints with Two-Tier Access Control**:

#### Tier 1: Analytics Endpoints (Authenticated Users)
These endpoints are accessible to any authenticated user with tenant isolation:

1. **`GET /admin/dashboard/overview`** - High-level statistics
   - Total messages analyzed
   - Average confidence, retrieval scores, response times
   - Low quality percentage
   - Feedback statistics (helpful vs not helpful)
   - Active knowledge gaps count

2. **`GET /admin/dashboard/trends`** - Daily quality trends
   - Time series data for quality metrics
   - Daily message counts
   - Daily feedback breakdown
   - Visualize quality improvement/degradation over time

3. **`GET /admin/gaps`** - List all knowledge gaps (read-only)
   - Filter by status (detected/acknowledged/resolved)
   - Sorted by occurrence count (most frequent first)
   - Shows example questions for each pattern

#### Tier 2: Management Endpoints (Admin Role Required)
These endpoints require admin role for security and resource reasons:

4. **`POST /admin/gaps/detect`** - Trigger gap detection manually
   - Runs TF-IDF clustering on recent low-quality messages (expensive)
   - Returns newly detected gaps

5. **`PATCH /admin/gaps/{id}/acknowledge`** - Mark gap as acknowledged
   - Admin has seen the issue
   - Optional notes field

6. **`PATCH /admin/gaps/{id}/resolve`** - Mark gap as resolved
   - Issue has been fixed (e.g., documentation added)
   - Required resolution notes

7. **`GET /admin/export/quality-report`** - Download CSV report (bulk export)
   - All quality metrics for specified time period
   - Includes feedback data
   - Quality issue flags
   - Opens in Excel/Google Sheets

---

### 3. Database Schema

**Knowledge Gaps Table** (already existed, now fully utilized):
- `question_pattern` - Generalized question pattern
- `example_questions` - JSON array of actual user questions
- `occurrence_count` - How many times this pattern appeared
- `avg_confidence` - Average answer confidence for this pattern
- `negative_feedback_count` - Number of thumbs down
- `status` - detected/acknowledged/resolved
- `resolution_notes` - How the gap was fixed

---

```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/api/v1/admin/dashboard/overview?days=7 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Expected**: Overview statistics with metrics, feedback, and gaps count.

#### Test 2: Trigger Gap Detection
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/admin/gaps/detect?days=7" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Expected**: List of detected knowledge gaps (if any low-quality messages exist).

#### Test 3: List Gaps
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/admin/gaps?status=detected" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Expected**: Array of gaps with question patterns and example questions.

#### Test 4: View Trends
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/admin/dashboard/trends?days=7" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

**Expected**: Daily trend data showing quality metrics over time.

#### Test 5: Export CSV
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8005/api/v1/admin/export/quality-report?days=30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -o quality-report.csv

# View in terminal
cat quality-report.csv

# Or open in Excel
open quality-report.csv
```

**Expected**: CSV file with detailed quality metrics.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Identify Knowledge Gaps

**Scenario**: You want to find out what topics users are asking about that your chatbot can't answer well.

**Who can do this**:
- **Regular users** can view existing gaps and analytics
- **Admins** can trigger gap detection and manage gaps

**Steps**:
1. **View existing gaps** (regular user): `GET /admin/gaps?status=detected`
2. **Trigger gap detection** (admin only): `POST /admin/gaps/detect?days=7`
3. Review detected gaps and see example questions
4. Add relevant documentation to fix the gap
5. **Mark as resolved** (admin only): `PATCH /admin/gaps/{id}/resolve`

### Use Case 2: Monitor Quality Trends

**Scenario**: You want to see if quality is improving after adding new documentation.

**Who can do this**: **Any authenticated user** (regular or admin)

**Steps**:
1. Get baseline: `GET /admin/dashboard/overview?days=30` (before adding docs)
2. Add new documentation to your knowledge base
3. Wait a few days
4. Check trends: `GET /admin/dashboard/trends?days=30`
5. Compare avg_confidence and feedback percentages

### Use Case 3: Export Data for Analysis

**Scenario**: You want to analyze quality data in Excel/Google Sheets.

**Who can do this**: **Admin only** (bulk data export requires elevated privileges)

**Steps**:
1. Export: `GET /admin/export/quality-report?days=90` (admin token required)
2. Open CSV in Excel
3. Create pivot tables, charts, and custom analysis
4. Share with stakeholders

## Technical Details

### Gap Detection Algorithm

```python
# Simplified flow
def detect_gaps(tenant_id, days):
    # 1. Get low-quality messages
    messages = get_messages_with(
        confidence < 0.5 OR
        negative_feedback = True
    )

    # 2. Vectorize questions
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(questions)

    # 3. Calculate similarity
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(vectors)

    # 4. Cluster similar questions
    for i in range(len(questions)):
        cluster = [questions[i]]
        for j in range(i+1, len(questions)):
            if similarity[i][j] >= 0.7:  # 70% threshold
                cluster.append(questions[j])

        # 5. Create gap if pattern repeats
        if len(cluster) >= 2:
            create_knowledge_gap(cluster)
```

### Performance Considerations

- **TF-IDF**: Fast, no ML model training required
- **Clustering**: O(nÂ²) but runs on small datasets (low-quality messages only)
- **Caching**: Results stored in database, don't need to re-cluster
- **Async**: Gap detection can run in background without blocking requests

### Security

- **Two-tier access control**:
  - **Tier 1 (Analytics)**: Dashboard, trends, gap listing - requires authentication only
  - **Tier 2 (Management)**: Gap detection, modifications, exports - requires admin role
- **Tenant isolation** - users only see their own organization's data (automatic via JWT tenant_id)
- **No destructive operations** - gaps are soft-deleted (status change only)
- **Justification for admin-only operations**:
  - Gap detection: Computationally expensive (TF-IDF clustering)
  - Modifications: Prevents accidental data corruption
  - Exports: Bulk data access requires elevated privileges

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test all features** using the test script
2. **Review example gaps** to verify clustering works well
3. **Adjust thresholds** if needed (similarity, min occurrences)

### Short-term
1. **Schedule gap detection** to run daily via cron job
2. **Set up alerts** when quality drops below thresholds
3. **Create workflow** to automatically notify admins of new gaps

### Long-term
1. **Build frontend dashboard** using these APIs
2. **Advanced analytics** - predict quality issues before they happen
3. **Automated resolution** - suggest knowledge base improvements
