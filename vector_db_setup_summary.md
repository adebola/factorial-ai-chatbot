# Vector Database Configuration Summary

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Both the **onboarding service** and **chat service** have been successfully configured to use the `vector_db` schema for vector storage with PostgreSQL + pgvector.

### Database Schema
- **Schema**: `vector_db` 
- **Tables Created**:
  - `vector_db.document_chunks` - Stores document embeddings and content
  - `vector_db.vector_search_indexes` - Stores tenant indexing statistics

### Services Updated

#### Onboarding Service
- ✅ `app/services/pg_vector_ingestion.py` - Updated to use `vector_db` schema
- ✅ All SQL queries now reference `vector_db.document_chunks` and `vector_db.vector_search_indexes`
- ✅ Migration created: `7e861387aaed_migrate_vector_tables_to_vector_db_schema.py`

#### Chat Service  
- ✅ `app/services/pg_vector_store.py` - Updated to use `vector_db` schema
- ✅ All SQL queries now reference `vector_db.document_chunks` and `vector_db.vector_search_indexes`
- ✅ Vector similarity search configured for pgvector

### Migration Applied
```bash
# Migration successfully applied
alembic upgrade head
```

### Database Schema Verification
```sql
-- Schema exists
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name = 'vector_db';

-- Tables created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'vector_db';
```

### Key Features
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant's vectors are isolated by `tenant_id`
- **Deduplication**: Content hashing prevents duplicate embeddings
- **Performance**: Proper indexes for efficient similarity search
- **Vector Search**: Uses pgvector's `<=>` operator for similarity search
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI Ada-002 embeddings (1536 dimensions)

### Services Ready
Both services are now configured and ready to use the `vector_db` schema for:
- ✅ Document ingestion and vector storage
- ✅ Vector similarity search for RAG
- ✅ Tenant-specific vector isolation
- ✅ Performance monitoring and statistics

The ChromaDB to pgvector migration is complete and both services will now use PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for all vector operations.
