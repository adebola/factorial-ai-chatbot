# Conversational Workflow Service Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add a new **Workflow Service (Port 8002)** to enable tenants to create, manage, and execute complex conversational workflows with conditional logic, multi-step interactions, and integration capabilities.

## Architecture Design

### 1. New Microservice: Workflow Service
- **Location**: `./workflow-service/`
- **Port**: 8002
- **Technology**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (consistent with existing services)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (shared with existing services)
- **Cache**: Redis (shared for workflow state management)

### 2. Core Components

#### Workflow Engine
- **Workflow Parser**: YAML/JSON-based workflow definitions
- **State Machine**: Manages conversation state and transitions
- **Condition Evaluator**: Handles conditional logic and branching
- **Action Executor**: Executes workflow actions (API calls, integrations)
- **Variable Manager**: Handles workflow variables and context

#### User Interface for Workflow Creation
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows
- **Code Editor**: YAML/JSON editor for advanced users
- **Testing Environment**: Simulate workflows before deployment
- **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow templates

#### Integration Layer
- **Webhook Support**: Send/receive data from external systems
- **API Connectors**: Built-in connectors for common services
- **Custom Functions**: Allow JavaScript/Python custom logic
- **Database Actions**: Read/write to tenant databases

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `workflows`: Workflow definitions and metadata
- `workflow_versions`: Version history and rollback capability
- `workflow_executions`: Runtime execution tracking
- `workflow_states`: Current state of active conversations
- `workflow_variables`: Dynamic variables and context
- `workflow_templates`: Reusable workflow templates

## User Interaction Design

### 1. Workflow Creation Interface
**Dashboard → Workflows → Create New**

```yaml
# Example Workflow Definition
name: "Customer Support Escalation"
version: "1.0"
trigger:
  type: "message"
  conditions:
    - contains: ["help", "support", "issue"]

steps:
  - id: "greeting"
    type: "message"
    content: "Hi! I'm here to help. What type of issue are you experiencing?"

  - id: "collect_issue_type"
    type: "choice"
    options:
      - "Technical Problem"
      - "Billing Question"
      - "General Inquiry"
    variable: "issue_type"

  - id: "technical_flow"
    condition: "issue_type == 'Technical Problem'"
    type: "sub_workflow"
    workflow: "technical_support_flow"

  - id: "escalate"
    condition: "severity == 'high'"
    type: "action"
    action: "create_ticket"
    params:
      priority: "urgent"
      assignee: "support_team"
```

### 2. Management Interface
- **Workflow List**: View all workflows with status, usage stats
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Conversion rates, completion metrics
- **Testing Tools**: Simulate workflows with different inputs
- **Version Control**: Rollback, branching, A/B testing

### 3. Integration with Chat Service
- **Workflow Triggers**: Detect when to activate workflows
- **Context Handover**: Seamless transition between AI chat and workflow
- **Fallback Handling**: Return to AI chat if workflow fails

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Service Structure
```

├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── workflows.py          # CRUD operations
│   │   ├── executions.py         # Runtime management

│   │   └── webhooks.py           # External integrations
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── workflow_engine.py    # Core execution engine

│   └── ui/                       # Optional: Built-in workflow builder
├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt
```

### 2. Integration Points

#### With Chat Service
- **HTTP API**: `/api/v1/workflows/trigger` - Check if message should trigger workflow
- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time workflow state updates
- **Context Sharing**: Pass conversation context between services

#### With Authorization Server
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Secure workflow management APIs
- **Tenant Isolation**: All workflows scoped to tenant

#### With Gateway Service
- **Route Configuration**: Add workflow service routes
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute workflow execution load

### 3. Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Message Received** → Chat Service checks for workflow triggers
2. **Workflow Activated** → Context passed to Workflow Service
3. **State Management** → Redis stores current workflow state
4. **Step Execution** → Process current workflow step
5. **Condition Evaluation** → Determine next step based on logic
6. **Response Generation** → Send response back to chat
7. **State Persistence** → Save updated state for next interaction

## User Experience Design

### For Administrators
1. **Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface similar to Microsoft Power Automate
2. **Code Editor**: Advanced YAML/JSON editor with syntax highlighting
3. **Testing Suite**: Simulate workflows with mock data
4. **Analytics**: Track workflow performance and user engagement

### For End Users
1. **Seamless Integration**: Workflows feel like natural conversation
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show steps in multi-step workflows
3. **Fallback Options**: Easy exit to human support
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation history

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine (2-3 weeks)
- Basic workflow engine and state management
- Simple message/choice/action step types
- Integration with chat service
- Database schema and models

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- Conditional logic and branching
- Variable management and templating
- Webhook integrations
- Testing environment

### Phase 3: User Interface (3-4 weeks)
- Visual workflow builder
- Management dashboard
- Template library
- Analytics and reporting

### Phase 4: Advanced Integrations (2-3 weeks)
- External API connectors
- Custom function support
- A/B testing capabilities
- Performance optimization

## Technical Considerations

- **Scalability**: Workflow executions should be stateless where possible
- **Reliability**: Implement retry logic and failure handling
- **Security**: All workflow definitions must be tenant-isolated
- **Performance**: Cache frequently accessed workflows and templates
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics for workflow execution

## Example Use Cases

### Customer Support Workflow
1. User mentions "billing issue"
2. Workflow triggers and collects account details
3. Checks account status via API
4. Routes to appropriate support queue
5. Creates ticket with context

### Lead Qualification Workflow
1. User shows interest in pricing
2. Workflow collects company size, use case
3. Calculates recommended plan
4. Schedules demo if qualified
5. Updates CRM with lead data

### Onboarding Workflow
1. New user joins chat
2. Workflow guides through setup steps
3. Collects preferences and configuration
4. Creates initial workspace
5. Sends welcome email with next steps

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Automatic workflow optimization based on usage patterns
- **Voice Integration**: Support for voice-based workflow interactions
- **Multi-channel**: Extend workflows to email, SMS, and social media
- **Marketplace**: Community-contributed workflow templates
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversion funnels, user journey mapping
